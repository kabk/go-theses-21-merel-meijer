      For many years now Egypte has wanted to have the bust of Nefertiti back. In 1930, Egypte made their first attempt by requesting the return of the bust, but the German government declined. In 2009, the collectoin’s director of the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection of the Neues Museum, Frederike Syfried claims that:
      <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
      “The position of the German side is clear and unambiguous - the acquisition of the bust by the Prussian state was legal.” (BBC, 2009)</div></div>

      <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">So because of this the Neues Museum is still refusing to give the bust back. The ignorant attitude of Berlin towards Egypte is a common demeanor in the discussion of looted cultural heritage objects and the question who the rightful owner is. Other European countries share this approach towards the claims countries make on their collections. England for example possesses the Parthenon Marbles13. These marbles are originally from Greece. Greece made countless attempts to get the Parthenon Marbles back, in vain England refused to renounce the statues. Their counter reactions were that London was the most suitable place to store them, that the air pollution in Athene would damage the Parthenon Marbles and that the statues will be placed in a museum that is not suitable for conservering the statues. These arguments are obsolete, because Engeland did not take good care of the Parthenon Marbles itself.
      The statues were irreplaceably damaged in their stay in the British Museum.</p>

      In 1936, Lord Duveen of Millbank, who was an influential British art dealer, recommended that the statues should be thoroughly cleaned. He believed that the statues should be white. Incompetent cleaners were using chisels, caustic chemicals and steel wool. This resulted in the damage of 80 percent of the surface of the Parthenon Marbles and the loss of a lot of details on the marbles(Visser, 2017).

      <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">This attitude shows that there is still inequality in how Western societies behaves towards the countries that were their former colonies. With declining requests about the return of the art objects and with the arguments they use, European museums are degrading the countries exactly in the way they did during the colonization.</p>

  <div class="bodytext">
    The discussion about how the Western societies are managing the looted cultural heritage objects and how their attitude is towards the countries that originally owned them, caused a lot of commotion. People criticize the museum and government14 in how they deal with the looted cultural heritage objects. Every country has another history and through the course of their past reacts differently on this issue. When we look at Germany their response was completely different than the Netherlands or France. This is because the colonies that German15 acquired were taken away from them in the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. When the other European countries were occupied with their colonies after World War II, Germany was handling something completely different, the aftermath of this war. Nicholas Thomas, director of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge, said about this:

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “The public historical debate in Germany was completely absorbed by consideration of the Nazi past and of the ramifications of division. There has been much more discussion of empires in Britain, France and the Netherlands, where people in museums have thought much more about where collections have come from, and there is a deeper awareness of the sheer historical complexity.” (Bowley, 2018)
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">The conversation about the looted cultural heritage object started in Germany with the opening of Humboldt Forum in 2018 in Berlin. The museum collection consists of many ethnological objects that were accumulated during the colonial era. The discussion of bringing back stolen artifacts has been going on for a very long time, so why would Germany think that it would be a good idea to create a new museum that represents looted cultural heritage objects? With showing a Buddist temple and boats from the South Pacific, the Humboldt Forum will give an example of how open Germany is to the world. It would also give Germany another world-class institution, tantamount to the British Museum or the Louvre (Bowley, 2018). Edward Said explains in his book Orientalism that when Western countries consistently represent looted cultural heritage objects that are not connected to the Western culture, they retain the Western view of the Orient:</p>
    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “That Orientalism16 makes sense at all depends more on the West than on the Orient, and this sense is directly indebted to various Western techniques of representation that make the Orient visible, clear, “there” in discourse about it. And these representations rely upon institutions, traditions, conversations, agree-upon codes of understanding for their effects, not upon a distant and amorphous Orient.” (Said, 1978, p. 22)
    </div></div>

  <div class="bodytext_groot">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">So the reason why they wanted to develop this museum is in conflict with what they represent and how they displayed it. A museum that exhibits looted cultural heritage objects is not showing how open they are for other cultures, but how closed they are by not giving the cultures who are the original owners of the objects an opportunity to get access to that object. People were not amused by the building of the Humboldt Forum. In February 2018, hundred protesters marched through Berlin’s streets to the Humboldt Forum. The protesters gave speeches and held signs that said:</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    “Tell the Truth About Germany’s Colonial History,”
    “Clear Out the Colonial Treasury” and “It’s Your Duty to Remember.”
      </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">One protester, Christian Kopp, addressed that no matter what the founders had intended, the museum would forever be associated with the blood of the empire.</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “This,”
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">  he said, pointing to the grand stone facade of the Humboldt Forum,</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    “will be a memorial to the colonial era!”
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">(Bowley, 2018).
    One of the Forum’s three founding directors, Horst Bredekamp, who is an art historian, defines this protest as a</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    “psychogram of Germany’’
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">  and said that the critical pushback is hijacking the original purpose of focusing on German scientific enlightenment and exploration (Bowley, 2018). Not everybody that works for the Neues Museum was agreeing with the museum’s representation.
    The discussion around the construction of the Humbort Forum led for example to the resignation of Bénédicte Savoy, an advisory board member of the museum.</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    He states that the museum does not reflect modern Germany that is changed by immigration (Bowley, 2018).
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">People see the Humboldt Form as something positive or negative. With the building of The Forum the starting point of this debate between the two sides surrounding stolen cultural heritage objects in Germany began.
    The professor of the University of Hamburg and expert on African history and colonialism, Jürgen Zimmerer, said</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    “There is a lot more at stake than just the museum. The political colonial debate has become the defining debate in Germany and the Humboldt Forum is at the center of it” (Bowley, 2018).
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;"> One of the Forum’s three founding directors Neil MacGregor said:</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    “It is called a “forum” because its organizers want it to be more than a museum — a place for meeting, discussing and investigation of big global issues like immigration” (Bowley, 2018).
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;"> The Humboldt Forum would be a wonderful place to start the conversation between the museum and the protesters. Like MacGregor said it is a place for discussing big global issues. What better way to talk about the colonial debate in a controversial building that provoked the discussion. One of the solutions for opening up the conversation with museums is talking to them and educating them. The Humboldt Forum came in action after the debate around the looted cultural heritage objects. They want to get rid of the assumptions that the Forum demonstrates only the German take on the world.
    So they made a proposal to introduce people that represent the countries where the objects originated from. Another result that resoluted out of the debate is that the German Lost Art Foundation, that focusses on the investigation of Nazi-looted art, is giving the museum a change to get a grant for the research of the colonial origin (Bowley, 2018).
    With these actions the museum and Germany shows that they are open for change.</p>
