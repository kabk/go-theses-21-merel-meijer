      Curating history from the Western point
      of view has been going on for a very long
      time. The attitude of the Western societies
      towards the looted cultural heritage is now
      finally changing. This change is very complicated
      because every party involved has
      other importance. In this part of the thesis
      I will elaborate the change and relevance of
      the reaction the narrative of a looted cultural
      heritage object provokes.

      For many years now Egypte has wanted to have <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i> back. In 1930, Egypte made their first attempt by requesting the return of the bust, but the German government declined. In 2009, the collectoin’s director of the <i>Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection</i> of <i>the Neues Museum</i>, Frederike Syfried claims that:

    <div class="toptexts2_neg" id="toptexts2_neg">
      <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
      “The position of the German side is clear and unambiguous - the acquisition of the bust by the Prussian state was legal.” (BBC, 2009)</p></div>

      <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">So because of this the Neues Museum is still refusing to give the bust back. The ignorant attitude of Berlin towards Egypte is a common demeanor in the discussion of looted cultural heritage objects and the question who the rightful owner is. Other European countries share this approach towards the claims countries make on their collections. England for example possesses the <i>Parthenon Marbles</i>
        <input type="checkbox" id="cb0" /><label for="cb0"><sup><n>13</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small>The Parthenon Marbles are a selection of marble sculptures, also known as Elgin
      Marbles. They were initially constructed in the temple of the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis
      of Athens (“Elgin Marbles”, 2020).</small></i><br><br></span> {<i>Figure 1.2</i>}. These marbles are originally from Greece. Greece made countless attempts to get the <i>Parthenon Marbles</i> back, in vain England refused to renounce the statues. Their counter reactions were that London was the most suitable place to store them, that the air pollution in Athene would damage the <i>Parthenon Marbles</i> and that the statues will be placed in a museum that is not suitable for conservering the statues. These arguments are obsolete, because Engeland did not take good care of the <i>Parthenon Marbles</i> itself.
      The statues were irreplaceably damaged in their stay in the British Museum.</p>

      In 1936, Lord Duveen of Millbank, who was an influential British art dealer, recommended that the statues should be thoroughly cleaned. He believed that the statues should be white. Incompetent cleaners were using chisels, caustic chemicals and steel wool. This resulted in the damage of 80 percent of the surface of the <i>Parthenon Marbles</i> and the loss of a lot of details on the marbles(Visser, 2017).

      <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">This attitude shows that there is still inequality in how Western societies behaves towards the countries that were their former colonies. With declining requests about the return of the art objects and with the arguments they use, European museums are degrading the countries exactly in the way they did during the colonization.</p>

    <p STYLE="margin:4px; margin-left:34.5px; margin-top:8px;">Changing of attitude</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bodytext">
    The discussion about how the Western societies are managing the looted cultural heritage objects and how their attitude is towards the countries that originally owned them, caused a lot of commotion. People criticize the museum and government<input type="checkbox" id="cb1" /><label for="cb1"><sup><n>14</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small>A part of the
    collections of museums are state property, so not only museums are playing a role in the discussion, but also the government (Aksioma, 2019).</small></i><br><br></span> in how they deal with the looted cultural heritage objects. Every country has another history and through the course of their past reacts differently on this issue. When we look at Germany their response was completely different than the Netherlands or France.
    This is because the colonies that German<input type="checkbox" id="cb2" /><label for="cb2"><sup><n>15</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small>The colonies of Germany were
    German South-West Africa, Togo, German East Africa, Wituland, Kaiser-Wilhelms-Land and the Bismarck-archipel (Duitsland instituut, n.d.).</small></i><br><br></span> acquired were taken away from them in the <i>Treaty of Versailles</i> that ended World War I. When the other European countries were occupied with their colonies after World War II, Germany was handling something completely different, the aftermath of this war. Nicholas Thomas, director of the <i>Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology</i> at Cambridge, said about this:

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “The public historical debate in Germany was completely absorbed by consideration of the Nazi past and of the ramifications of division. There has been much more discussion of empires in Britain, France and the Netherlands, where people in museums have thought much more about where collections have come from, and there is a deeper awareness of the sheer historical complexity.” (Bowley, 2018)
    </p>
  </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">The conversation about the looted cultural heritage object started in Germany with the opening of <i>Humboldt Forum</i> in 2018 in Berlin. The museum collection consists of many ethnological objects that were accumulated during the colonial era. The discussion of bringing back stolen artifacts has been going on for a very long time, so why would Germany think that it would be a good idea to create a new museum that represents looted cultural heritage objects? With showing a Buddist temple and boats from the South Pacific, the <i>Humboldt Forum</i> will give an example of how open Germany is to the world. It would also give Germany another world-class institution, tantamount to the <i>British Museum</i> or <i>the Louvre</i> (Bowley, 2018). Edward Said explains in his book Orientalism that when Western countries consistently represent looted cultural heritage objects that are not connected to the Western culture, they retain the Western view of the Orient:</p>
  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “That Orientalism<input type="checkbox" id="cb3" /><label for="cb3"><sup><n>16</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small>Orientalism signifies the study by
      Western academics of Near and Far Eastern languages and cultures (Orientalism - New World Encyclopedia, n.d.).</small></i><br><br></span> makes sense at all depends more on the West than on the Orient, and this sense is directly indebted to various Western techniques of representation that make the Orient visible, clear, “there” in discourse about it. And these representations rely upon institutions, traditions, conversations, agree-upon codes of understanding for their effects, not upon a distant and amorphous Orient.” (Said, 1978, p. 22)
    </p>

  <div class="bodytext_groot">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">So the reason why they wanted to develop this museum is in conflict with what they represent and how they displayed it. A museum that exhibits looted cultural heritage objects is not showing how open they are for other cultures, but how closed they are by not giving the cultures who are the original owners of the objects an opportunity to get access to that object. People were not amused by the building of the <i>Humboldt Forum</i>. In February 2018, hundred protesters marched through Berlin’s streets to the <i>Humboldt Forum</i>. The protesters gave speeches and held signs that said:</p>

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “Tell the Truth About Germany’s Colonial History,”
    “Clear Out the Colonial Treasury” and “It’s Your Duty to Remember.”
    </p>
  </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">One protester, Christian Kopp, addressed that no matter what the founders had intended, the museum would forever be associated with the blood of the empire.</p>

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “This,”
    </p>
  </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">  he said, pointing to the grand stone facade of the <i>Humboldt Forum</i>,</p>

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “will be a memorial to the colonial era!”
    </p>
  </div>


    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">(Bowley, 2018).
    One of the Forum’s three founding directors, Horst Bredekamp, who is an art historian, defines this protest as a</p>

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “psychogram of Germany"
    </p>
  </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">  and said that the critical pushback is hijacking the original purpose of focusing on German scientific enlightenment and exploration (Bowley, 2018). Not everybody that works for the <i>Neues Museum<i> was agreeing with the museum’s representation.
    The discussion around the construction of the Humbort Forum led for example to the resignation of Bénédicte Savoy, an advisory board member of the museum.</p>

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    He states that the museum does not reflect modern Germany that is changed by immigration (Bowley, 2018).
    </p>
  </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">People see the Humboldt Form as something positive or negative. With the building of The Forum the starting point of this debate between the two sides surrounding stolen cultural heritage objects in Germany began.
    The professor of the University of Hamburg and expert on African history and colonialism, Jürgen Zimmerer, said</p>

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “There is a lot more at stake than just the museum. The political colonial debate has become the defining debate in Germany and the Humboldt Forum is at the center of it” (Bowley, 2018).
    </p>
  </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;"> One of the Forum’s three founding directors Neil MacGregor said:</p>

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “It is called a “forum” because its organizers want it to be more than a museum — a place for meeting, discussing and investigation of big global issues like immigration” (Bowley, 2018).
    </p>
  </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;"> The <i>Humboldt Forum</i> would be a wonderful place to start the conversation between the museum and the protesters. Like MacGregor said it is a place for discussing big global issues. What better way to talk about the colonial debate in a controversial building that provoked the discussion. One of the solutions for opening up the conversation with museums is talking to them and educating them.
    The <i>Humboldt Forum</i> came in action after the debate around the looted cultural heritage objects. They want to get rid of the assumptions that the Forum demonstrates only the German take on the world.
    So they made a proposal to introduce people that represent the countries where the objects originated from. Another result that resoluted out of the debate is that the <i>German Lost Art Foundation</i>, that focusses on the investigation of Nazi-looted art, is giving the museum a change to get a grant for the research of the colonial origin (Bowley, 2018).
    With these actions the museum and Germany shows that they are open for change.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="bodytext_groot">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;"> In September this year the activist Mwazulu Diyabanza stole a Congolese grave statue from the <i>Afrika Museum</i> in Berg en Dal. He uploaded a video of this action on Youtube {<i>Figure 2.2</i>}. Under the video he wrote a statement against the colonization that destroyed Africa (Van Gruijthuijsen, 2020):<input type="checkbox" id="cb4" /><label for="cb4"><sup><n>17</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small>This statement was originally written in French.</small></i><br><br></span></p>
  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
     <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “For nearly 800 years today, the Dutch and the Portuguese have destroyed AFRICA to allow their Belgian, French and British fellows to come and help themselves afterwards. The Dutch by destroying and plundering African works of art have dried up the source of inspiration of our artists and our artisans. This has not failed to destroy the African textile industry which also draws its source
    from plants and particularly trees which also produce wood for our works of art.
    This museum is a museum of missions, founded by Catholic missionaries with the objective of definitively breaking the African as well as the African and corrupting their souls. We are Venus to receive what has been forcibly taken from us,
    and ethics recommend that anything that has been forcibly taken should be returned and taken back. This act is both a message for our children and grandchildren but also
    for all who believed to have broken AFRICA and its people. To continue the fight even 1000 centuries later... I am here to translate our common suffering into happiness, to see our goods returned and to go home.
    We are not outlaws but we fight their outlaws, prevaricators, thieves, rapists and receivers. The Afrika Museum in Berg en dal, Holland closes nearly 450,000
    African pieces looted and stolen under colonization and the slave raids and we bring everything back home. It is our heritage and its place is at home. We don’t ask the thief for permission to recover what he stole. Unity dignity courage” (BOBISO MÈDIA, 2020).

<p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">
    His robbery is a symbolic act. This is an extreme case of how far people can go with their actions to get the attention they deserve. You can debate that stealing is not the right way of dealing with this situation. For an attempt of stealing an registered artwork you can get a maximum imprisonment of 10 years plus a fine of 150 thousand euros (Kool, 2020).
    In this case you can argue that he did not do it to make money or display it in his own house. He did it to get the attention of the public. Within this story
    we have the thief and the victim. The thief becomes the victim and the victim can become the thief. Is the <i>African museum</i> really the victim here of a crime or is it not
    a crime because what they possess was never for them to keep? Valika Smeulders, the head of the history department in the <i>Rijksmuseum</i> in Amsterdam, was on Tuesday 20th of October 2020, a guest in the radio program “<i>Kunststof</i>”. She commented on the act of Mwazulu Diyabanza, explaining that his goal with stealing the object was to get attention and to get picked up by the news.
    His move set the discussion in motion about “stolen” artifacts presented in museums (Brouwer, 2020).
    After this event occurred the Council for Culture<input type="checkbox" id="cb5" /><label for="cb5"><sup><n>18</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small> The Council of Culture advises the Dutch Government and Parliament on the arts, culture and media. They implement recommendations concerning the cultural procedure in the Netherlands (Raad voor Cultuur, 2020).</small></i><br><br></span>
    gave advice to the minister Van Engelshoven<input type="checkbox" id="cb6" /><label for="cb6"><sup><n>19</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small> She is the minister of Education, Culture and Science
    (NOS, 2020).</small></i><br><br></span>, In this advice they state that the Netherlands need to give all the colonial heritage back to the countries of origin, if there is reasonable proof that those countries have lost the objects involuntarily. The historical injustice that occurred in the colonial past can not be undone, but we can work on the recovery of injustice with how we treat the colonial objects by taking responsibility for the past (NOS, 2020).
    The objects that the Council is referring to are the items originally from Suriname and Indonesia obtained in the colonial wars when they were governed by the Netherlands. Most of these objects were not obtained honorably. So it is important to start a conversation with these countries about giving back the objects, declares the Council.
    The council states:</p>

  <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
   <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
    “watch out for a neo-colonial repetition of the past in which one’s own views, feelings, norms and values
    are the guiding principles for actions” (NOS, 2020).
   </p>
 </div>

 <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">
    The Council of Culture concludes that the minister Van Engelshoven will become the representative of the state that decides if the colonial objects will return to their country of origin or will stay in the Netherlands.
    An independent advisory committee should help here within these tasks. According to the council an expertisecentrum needs to be assembled, that would investigate provenance of the refund requested cultural objects and set up a database.
    Museums need to start investigating the provenance history of their colonial cultural objects (NOS, 2020). This is a necessary step in acknowledging the misrepresentation of the looted cultural heritage objects.
    As a result of this we can start working on the solution of representing the looted cultural heritage in an impartial way.

</div>

<div class="introcon">
  <p STYLE="margin-top: -2vh;">
  To summarize, the attitude around dealing with looted cultural heritage objects shows that there is still inequality in how Western societies behave towards the countries that were their former colonies.
  Every country responds differently towards this issue, because of their own history. People are standing up and are debating about in what way our society is representing the looted cultural heritage. The protest appears in different forms and carries a lot of emotion, like the narrative of Nefertiti.
