     She is captured in a glass case untouchable for the outside world. Her story contains twisted truths, created by various parties. The only one that knows the real story is the representation of her in the glass case. Her pervasive look expresses her emotion and
     state of mind. Her ears are damaged by all the different voices she heard over the years.
     Her facial expression looks tense. She wants to speak her mind, but is unable to. Her
     stillness is saying way more than all the voices that are surrounding her. Her crown is making her stand taller even though you only see her head. She represents a portrait of a woman, known as Nefertiti {<i>Figure 1.0</i>}, The queen of Egypt during the 14th century B.C. She is one of the most iconic symbols of Egypt, located in Berlin (Biography.com Editors, 2019).

For many years there has been a discussion about the claiming of looted cultural heritage objects. The human centered approach creates this narrative. Countries, museums, activists, artists and philosophers have their own interest and opinion in this story. Everybody has a reason to act and express themselves in a certain way. I found myself making my stand in the story, but realised that I did not know where I was standing because I did not understand how this narrative was curated. Eward Said, a Palestinian American scholar who analyzed social and cultural politics in literature, wrote in his book <i>Orientalism</i><input type="checkbox" id="cb1" /><label for="cb1"><sup><n>2</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small>Orientalism observes the behavior of

(Said, 1978, p. xii).

This can be seen in the stories of looted cultural heritage objects. To understand people's behavior I am answering in my thesis the question: how does the human centered approach influence the narrative of a looted cultural heritage object, with in this case specific focus on <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i>?

<p STYLE="text-indent: 10%">
The Western society is so focused on the future that we forget that the past is still present. That is why it is important to talk about the stories of looted cultural heritage objects. For Western societies these objects present the past, but for the countries where the object was looted from, this is still a part of their culture. The Western society needs to dwell on the fact that their history is not only representing power and fame, but also its counterparts. They need to take responsibility for it. Researching and writing about this issue is for me a way to understand the narrative of the looted cultural heritage object and be part of the conversation that is changing it into the right representation.

The stories of the looted cultural heritage objects exist out of three parts: outwrite, overwrite and rewrite. Outwrite means to exceed in capability to write (Merriam-Webster, 1828). This happens at the beginning of the story of the looted cultural heritage object. The narrative gets shaped by people that claim unjustly the object and its story. The object obtained loses its identity and becomes decontextualized in a new narrative. Overwrite means destroying the already saved data by recording the new data over it (Farlex, n.d.-b). After the narrative is curated in its new form, people react to this development. In this process the overwriting starts. The public shapes its opinion and the discussion emerges. The narrative that once was accepted gets questioned. As a result, the rewriting process starts. Rewrite means writing repeated in a contrasting or enhanced form (Farlex, n.d.-b). People’s behavior and point of view changed over time. With the process of acknowledging the problem in this behavior, the possibility appears of rewriting history.

In my thesis I use the term cultural heritage objects. I use this term to describe the objects that were looted from their original place and that represent a culture that through this object expresses their identity. I chose to use this term, because I talk about objects that got placed out of context by outsiders when it still has its meaning for the originated culture. So therefore it is necessary to highlight the importance of this object.
