     In my thesis I research how the narrative around looted cultural heritage objects gets
created. I wanted to research this subject, because for Western societies these objects
present the past, but for the countries where the object was looted from, this is still a part of
their culture. With not changing the narrative of the object, the disbalance between the
Western Society and the countries that were their former colonies will never change.
I wanted to find out how the human centered approach influenced the narrative of a looted
cultural heritage object, with in this case specific focus on <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i>.
There are different parties involved, so by understanding them, I could figure out how the
issue is structured. After writing my thesis, I can conclude that I still share the same values
as the countries that are fighting for their right to have access to their cultural heritage object.
In my thesis, I found out that the solution for approaching the issue around looted cultural
heritage objects is communication. With this we can collectively start creating a new
narrative around these object.
