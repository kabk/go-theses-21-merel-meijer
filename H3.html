      In the narrative of the <i>bust of Nefertiti</i>,
      Nefertiti has been represented in different
      shapes. All the parties that are involved in
      her story, have a connection with her that
      we can not forget. The meaning of what <i>the
      bust of Nefertiti</i> originally presented completely
      changes. In this part of the thesis I
      will elaborate how we can influence the narrative
      of a looted cultural heritage object.

  <p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">
  The artist Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles made a project about <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i>, called <i>The Other Nefertiti</i> {<i>Figure 1.3</i>}. They 3D scanned <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i> in the <i>Neues Museum</i> and published the data on the Hacker Congress.<input type="checkbox" id="cb0" /><label for="cb0"><sup><n>20</n></sup></label><span><br><br><i><small>The Hacker Congress is a conference where engineers, designers and programmers examine the current innovations and development in the computer industry
  (“The Hackers Conference”, 2020).</small></i><br><br></span>
  The <i>Neues Museum</i> did not respond to this action. Until <i>The New York Times</i> wrote an article about the project and called the museum and asked if they wanted to make a statement for the article.
  The <i>Neues Museum</i> stated that they were not amused by the act and they might be sueing the artists. This shows how closed and afraid the museum is to grant public access to their collection. The Museum made a 3D scan themselves,
  but did not publish the data of the bust and kept the object secure. Mainly because they made around 1.6 million euros by licensing their assets and their data. Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles concluded after all the arguments and dialogue they had in the aftermath of <i>the Other Nefertiti</i> project that they like to see museums more as a process and a space of constant negotiation.
  That museums will have an ethical or even a moral compass. Because of the constant movement in the world, museums can not stand still and hold on to the past. They can represent it, but in a way that they keep up with the movement around them.
  Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles exhibited their own representation of <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i>, without being painted, like the original one. By making the statue their own, it does not become a copy of the original. This project was an emancipatory act to free the data and the form itself, so it makes it possible to tell new stories (Aksioma, 2019).
  </p>
  <p STYLE="text-indent: 15%; margin-left: 10%;">After Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles published the 3D scan data of the bust of Nefertiti online, thousands of remakes were made of Nefertiti {<i>Figure 2.3</i>}.
  This brings up the question about originality. With reproducing <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i> the value of the object changed. The process of commodification arises. This means that the results of the aspects of human action are expressed in monetary value instead of inherent value (“Commodificatie”, 2018). Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles encountered this a lot as an argument by museums, why they are not opening up their collections (Aksioma, 2019).

Thutmose will never know how important his representation of Nefertiti would become. <i>The bust of Nefertiti</i> represents way more than only Nefertiti herself. She transformed into a powerful figure in contemporary art. Artists have tried to show with <i>the Bust of Nefertiti</i> what it implies to use the image of Nefertiti to appropriate, reimagine and misrepresent. Egyptian, German and American artists have reinterpreted the bust in a way to make people aware about the problems of claiming a narrative that is not yours to claim. The artists use the bust as a starting point of the conversation about identity and ownership
(McDonald, 2019).
</p>
<p STYLE="text-indent: 15%; margin-left: 10%;">
{<i>Figure 3.3</i>} A bust that has exactly the same head and breast piece as <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i>, but a different face. All the details, like the right white eye and the broken ears are the same, except the face expression is different. Nefertiti’s face is replaced by the face of the artist of the sculpture, Mehdi-Georges Lahlou. The work is called
<i>“I used to be Nefertiti”</i>. With merging its own face with the face of Nefertiti’s, the artist contemplates Nefertiti as
a nostalgic symbol of femininity (McDonald, 2019).
Mehdi-Georges Lahlou is a French Moroccan artist that works with the body, space and memory from a new perspective of critical practices and the diverse processes that define contemporary art (Jan van Eyck Academie, n.d.).
</p>
<p STYLE="text-indent: 15%; margin-left: 10%;">
{<i>Figure 4.3</i>} The bust of Nefertiti, represented five times in different skin tones. Fred Wilson, a Bronx-born artist of African descent, is the creator of this intriguing piece called <i>“Grey Area (Brown version)”</i>. The color of the busts are characterizing the color-coding of blackness, brownness and whiteness the modern society addresses. With <i>Grey Area (Brown version)</i> Wilson wants to raise awareness for the dismissal or confirmation of Nefertiti’s racial identity. That people become conscious of the impact it has (McDonald, 2019). In his work Fred Wilson challenges the presumption of history, art, culture, and display. He uses objects and cultural symbols, as a way
of reframing them and thereby adjusting the traditional interpretation. His aim is to encourage spectators to
reevaluate historical and social narratives
(Pace Gallery, n.d.).
</p>
<p STYLE="text-indent: 15%; margin-left: 10%;">
{<i>Figure 5.3</i>} Seven Nefertiti heads, positioned in a row, Nefertiti’s eyes covered by a different pair of sunglasses. The busts are presented on white pillars, the first one captured by a corset, making the pillar look like a body extension of Nefertiti’s head. Seven <i>Mona Lisa’s</i> leaning against every single pillar. <i>The bust of Nefertiti</i> and the <i>Mona Lisa</i> represent feminine beauty and the position of women in art history (Sleek Magazine, 2012). This work is part of the <i>“Nofretete”</i> series, made by Isa Genzken,  (McDonald, 2019). In her work Genzken confronts the social climate of capitalism and the circumstances of human experience in modern society (Hauser & Wirth, n.d.).
</p>
<p STYLE="text-indent: 15%; margin-left: 10%;">
{<i>Figure 6.3</i>} The bust of Nefertiti 2D lighting up with neon lights. <i>Nefertiti (Black Power)</i> displays the bust of Nefertiti in another light, it serves as an advertising tool. The artwork is only seen from the side, you can not look Nefertiti right into her eyes. It feels like she is abstractified, there is no connection anymore. The Ethiopian artist Awol Erizku uses the image of Nefertiti in his work to assert her utility as an historical reference point for black cultural ascendancy  (McDonald, 2019).
</p>
<p STYLE="text-indent: 15%; margin-left: 10%;">
{<i>Figure 7.3</i>} Here Awol Erizku represents Nefertiti as a discobal in <i>Nefertiti—Miles Davis</i>. The surface of the bust is covered in mirrors. He presents Nefertiti as discobal to associate her with black culture.
</p>
<p STYLE="text-indent: 15%; margin-left: 10%;">
{<i>Figure 8.3</i>} <i>The bust of Nefertiti</i> is formed through layers of bronze. Her features are unrecognizable, no colour, no detail just the shape. The transparency makes room for a reinterpretation of Nefertiti was and is. A work created by Julian Voss-Andreae in 2016, called <i>“Quantum Nefertiti”</i> (McDonald, 2019).
He is a German sculpture that combines figurative sculptures with scientific observation into the nature of reality (Biography | Julian Voss-Andreae, n.d.).

The looted cultural heritage object depicts a shared history between the country that possesses the object and the country where the object is originally from. The question is where will the object be displayed when it is for both countries a valuable object that represents their history. Both histories are equally important to tell. The generations that will follow need to understand where their identities come from, but also what their history is (NOS, 2020). The looted cultural heritage object became a part of the Western society in another context then it was originally intended by the cultures that made that object. For Western Societies the objects represent the past, but for the country of origin it still has the same value as before it was taken from them. The two histories have two completely different sides in how they tell the story.
Edward Said defines this in his book <i>Orientalism</i>:

<div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
   <p STYLE="margin-left: 20%;">
“Each of these phases and eras produces its own distorted knowledge of each other, each its own reductive images, its own disputatious polemics”
(Said, 1978, p. xv).
</div>

<p STYLE="margin-left: 10%;">
The <i>Tropenmuseum</i> in Amsterdam portrays this in a very interesting way. They present two artworks that visualize the periods from the Netherlands’ colonial past. One is the painting of Dutch Artist, Andries Beeckman, he was commissioned by the Dutch East-India Company in 1656 to assemble the painting
<i>“Het Kasteel Batavia gezien van Kali Besar west met op de voorgrond de vismarkt” (Batavia Castle seen from Kali Besar west with the fish market in the foreground)</i> {<i>Figure 9.3</i>} (Beeckman, 1656). This painting shows an idealist view on Batavia. The other artwork is made by Sitisiwan (origin unknown) and was made in the first half of 20th century, circa 1920, during the rise of nationalism in Java {<i>Figure 10.3</i>}. The roll critiques the Dutch government in Java. This artwork represented the Dutch as fat and lazy, a metaphor of their authority and dominance (Tropenmuseum, 2020).
</p>
<p STYLE="text-indent: 15%; margin-left: 10%;">
Defining the ownership of a looted cultural heritage object does not always have to point into the direction of a country or culture, it can also be part of nature, the place where the object was found. Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles talk in their project <i>the Other Nefertiti</i> about the questions of restitution. They do not believe in possession or ownership of those objects. In Egypte they were asked for the opportunity,
not officially, to give the 3D print they made of <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i> with the 3D data, to the Ministry of Culture. For them this did not feel right. Their plan was to go to the desert and bury the 3D print where the original bust was found, to have a potential techno heritage which can be found at one point,
or we forever belong to nature (Aksioma, 2019).

    In short, various artists use the bust as a starting point of the conversation about identity and ownership. For Western Societies the objects represent the past, but for the country of origin it still has the same value as before it was looted from them. Still the two parties are intertwined in the narrative of the looted cultural heritage object. Both histories are equally important to tell. By freeing the object and its data, like what happened in the project
    <i>“Other Nefertiti”</i>, the new narrative can arise, the narrative of shared histories, opinions and meaning.
