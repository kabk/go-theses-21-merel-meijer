     This thesis illustrates an open wound that represents oppression and misrepresentation. It elaborates the story of <i>the bust of Nefertiti</i>. Through telling her story, I present the different parties that are involved in this discussion. The museums and government that act and react upon the discussion. The artist that protests through their work against the current narrative of Nefertiti. Philosophers that examine human behavior, to explain why our behavior and past is constructed in this way. And myself, the writer, trying to connect all those threads together.

<p STYLE="text-indent: 10%">
With my thesis I wanted to research how the human centered approach
influences the narrative of a looted cultural heritage object. The case of <i>the bust of
Nefertiti</i> shows that  every move in history can change the objectâ€™s narrative. From Ludwig Bochardt finding the bust, him being German and the Antiquities Service not choosing the bust so that it would stay in Egypte. All leads to the reason why the bust is now located in Berlin. Every decision influences how the story of the object gets shaped. Therefore is the narrative of the object a shared history, it is not just created by one person or country. Through my research I discovered that the solution is not giving the object to
one country or dismissing the other. The solution lies in communication. With starting
the conversation about the looted  cultural heritage objects, a new narrative can arise.
A narrative where the different representations of the object can come together. Starting a conversation between all the various parties that are involved is an opening for change. The people involved can share knowledge and objects that represent for all of them a part of their history. It is important to intertwine these stories and form a new narrative. By telling the truth and opening up to others, the past becomes something that we can learn from. So that we will not repeat our mistakes.

The Nefertiti case is only one example of many looted cultural heritage objects
that are represented in museums. By choosing the bust I tried to show that no matter
what kind of looted cultural heritage object you encounter in a museum, every one of them is detextualized by putting it on display. I hope that with this thesis, you become more aware about how we still represent the past in a distorted way.That everybody by acknowledging this problem can become part of the narrative and change it into something we can be proud and not ashamed of.
