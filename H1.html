  </div>

   <div class="bodytext">

    Queen Nefertiti was with her husband pharaoh Achnaton the ruler of Egypt from 1351 BC till 1334 BC (Hilts, 2017). They are known for the reforming of the state religion from being Polytheistic, believing in multiple gods, to monotheistic, believing in one god, the sun god Aten (Smarthistory, 2012). With this change in belief consequences followed, temples needed to close and the priests were forced to convert. Achnaton and Nefertiti altered their name to show the importance of their new belief into Akhenaten and Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti which meant “beautiful are the beauties of Aten, a beautiful woman has come” (Weird History, 2020). Their devotion to the sun god Atan was so severe that they assembled the city Amarna as a symbol to worship him. The followers of Atan were requested to move to this city by the pharaoh and the queen.

    <p STYLE="text-indent: 10%;">One of these people was Thusmose. He was a sculptor and had a workshop located next to the city center of Amarna, according to the map of Amarna. In 1340 BC he created in this workshop the bust of Nefertiti (Nefertiti: (Society for the Promotion of the Egyptian Museum Berlin), n.d.). Thutmose was the official court sculptor for pharaoh Achnaton and queen Nefertiti, he called himself “the king’s favorite and master of works” (Ireland, 2013).</p>

    <p STYLE="text-indent: 10%;">After the fall of the empire of Nefertiti and Achnaton, Amarna slowly vanished from the map. Millennium’s went by and layers of sand covered the city and thereby the bust of Nefertiti. The controversial narrative that we know nowadays of this powerful bust began on December 6, 1913. The day that Ludwig Borchardt and his team discovered the bust buried upside-down in the sandy remains on the floor of Thusmose’s excavated workshop (History.com Editors, 2019). Ludwig Bochardt was a German archaeologist. He studied Architecture and Egyptology, focussed on Ancient Egyptian architecture. His admiration and curiosity for Egypt led him to the excavations of the bust of Nefertiti.</p>

    <p STYLE="text-indent: 10%;">Borchardt’s team had an agreement to split the artifacts they found with the Egyptian government. </p> According to the Antiquities Law that came into existence in 1912 in Egypt,  the findings of the excavation had to be split in half, giving the first choice to the Antiquities Service5. The French managed the Egyptian Antiquities Department, this indicates that there was already a preexisting Western bias in place (Van de Beek, 2019). The bust of Nefertiti was part of the German portion and was consigned from the land she once ruled to a place she never knew existed. Her new home for the next 11 years was in the private residence of Jacques Simon, who funded the expedition (History.com Editors, 2019). In 1924, the bust of Nefertiti made her first real life public appearance in the Neues Museum in Berlin. This museum was established in 1855 and houses two galleries, one of these galleries is the Ägyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung, which presents the art of Antique Egypte (Bianchini, 2019).
    During World War II the bust of Nefertiti was hidden by the nazi’s in a salt mine. American troops found it after Hitlers death and placed it in a museum in West Berlin. The Neues Museum was rebuilt after it was bombed in the war, so in 2009 the bust returned to the museum (Weird History, 2020).

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">Looking back on the journey that the bust of Nefertiti made; from the workshop of Thutmose to the Neues Museum in Berlin, one thing is clear: her story develops from a Western point of view. Nowhere in the story of the finding of the bust, the Egptian side is depicted. Edward Said explained in his book Orientalism, why this occurs. What happens when the western point of view takes over and values their own interpretation the most. Said demonstrate this through the example of how the french writer Gustave Flaubert depicts Kuchuk Hanem, a Ghawazee6 dancer of Esna7 (“Kuchuk Hanem”, 2020):</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
      <div>“There is very little consent to be found, for example, in the fact that Flaubert’s encounter with an Egyptian courtesan produced a widely influential model of the Oriental woman; she never spoke for herself, she never represented her emotions, presence, or history. He spoke for and represented her. He was foreign, comparatively wealthy, male, and these were historical facts of domination that allowed him not only to possess Kuchuk Hamen physically but to speak for her and tell his readers in what way she was “typically Oriental.” My argument is that Flaubert’s situation of strength in relation to Kuchuk Hamen was not an isolated instance. It fairly stands for the pattern of relative strength between the East and West, and the discourse about the Orient that it enabled.”
      (Said, 1978, p. 6) </div>
    </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">From the moment that Ludwig Bogardt finds the bust and together with the Antiquities Service decides where the bust will be located, the narrative of the bust becomes an example of colonialism. Colonialism is defined as when the control or governing of a nation determines over a dependent country or communities. (“Colonialism”, n.d.). This explains why there are so many different interpretations of the story of Nefertiti. Through the years various parties had the authority over her and her narrative. Still, the bust of Nefertiti origin starts in Egypte, she is a symbol of their culture and history. By distorting the bust’s origin and what it represents, the connection between her and her identity got lost. The bust of Nefertiti got out of context the moment she was put on display in the museum. With her placement in the Neues Museum, the curators of this museum decide how the narrative of the bust cultivates.
    They determine what side of the story they highlight, in what kind of direction they want to lead the spectator. It is their interpretation. The following text is the description of the bust on the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin8 website. This shows how the Neues Museum is composing the viewer to look at the bust of Nefertiti from a Western point of view:</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
      “The colorfully painted bust of Nefertiti has already been described in so many catalog articles, art-historical treatises and specialist articles by well-known Egyptologists that one could leave it at this point with the famous words of Borchardt and only try to quote “describe is no use, look”. For this reason - as with the bust of the Pharaoh - only Borchardt’s own descriptions are to be cited, the conclusions of which are certainly worth discussing, but give an authentic picture of his precise powers of observation and should speak for themselves.”
      (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, n.d.)
    </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left:30%;">The attitude of the Western countries towards the originating countries of the stolen object ensures that the story of the object will be represented in a western point of view. Said wrote about this in his book Orientalism:</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
      “The exteriority of the representation is always governed by some version of the truism that if the Orient could represent itself, it would; since it cannot, the representation does the job, for the West9, and faute de mieux10 for the poor Orient. “Sie können sich nicht vertreten, sie müssen vertreten werden.”11 as Marx12 wrote in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.”  (Said, 1978, p. 21)

    <div class="bodytext">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">Museums have an important role in telling the story of a looted cultural heritage object. What museums tend to do is that they present their collections as being from dead civilizations, partly because the objects depict ancient times. The objects are decontextualized and because of this, they might become dead objects as well. That is why it is important that the missions of the museums is to make this knowledge and artifacts as accessible as possible. The question is to what extent do the museums try to reach these missions? The bust of Nefertiti is one of the highlights in the collection of the Neues Museum. This museum is open to the public, but this public is limited. Not everybody can come to Berlin, not everybody can pay the 12 euros entrance fee (Aksioma, 2019). This means that the people of the culture where the object is originally from need to pay a fee to have access to their own culture. In colonial times these people were treated horribly and were forced to distance themselves from their beliefs. Portraying the visualizations of these beliefs in museums in Western society is a fictional reality of what happened in the past. Making the collection approachable online, is a good way to include the public. The public that has no ability to travel or has no money to spare can thereby get involved. Sadly, when you enter the online collections database of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin the information is in German, even when you click on the EN icon, to get englisch access to the information, it does not change (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, n.d.). Without the possibility to access the information in English the group that gets an exclusive inside of the bust gets therefore smaller and smaller.
    In conclusion, the bust of Nefertiti made a long journey from where she was found to where she is located now. The journey is created from a Western point of view. The meaning of the bust  got lost the moment she was put on display in the museum. By granting limited access to the bust of Nefertiti, Germany will have the power over the narrative of the bust. By giving this power to one party the truth and history gets destroyed.</p>
