    The genesis of a new narrative
  </div>

  <div class="bodytext">

    Queen Nefertiti was with her husband pharaoh Achnaton the ruler of Egypt from 1351 BC till 1334 BC (Hilts, 2017). They are known for the reforming of the state religion from being Polytheistic, believing in multiple gods, to monotheistic, believing in one god, the sun god Aten (Smarthistory, 2012). With this change in belief consequences followed, temples needed to close and the priests were forced to convert. Achnaton and Nefertiti altered their name to show the importance of their new belief into Akhenaten and
    Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti which meant “beautiful are the beauties of Aten, a beautiful woman has come” (Weird History, 2020). Their devotion to the sun god Atan was so severe that they assembled the city Amarna as a symbol to worship him. The followers of Atan were requested to move to this city by the pharaoh and the queen.

    <p STYLE="text-indent: 10%;">One of these people was Thusmose. He was a sculptor and had a workshop located next to the city center of Amarna, according to the map of Amarna. In 1340 BC he created in this workshop the bust of Nefertiti (Nefertiti: (Society for the Promotion of the Egyptian Museum Berlin), n.d.). Thutmose was the official court sculptor for pharaoh Achnaton and queen Nefertiti, he called himself “the king’s favorite and master of works” (Ireland, 2013).</p>

    <p STYLE="text-indent: 10%;">After the fall of the empire of Nefertiti and Achnaton, Amarna slowly vanished from the map. Millennium’s went by and layers of sand covered the city and thereby the bust of Nefertiti. The controversial narrative that we know nowadays of this powerful bust began on December 6, 1913. The day that Ludwig Borchardt and his team discovered the bust buried upside-down in the sandy remains on the floor of Thusmose’s excavated workshop (History.com Editors, 2019). Ludwig Bochardt was a German archaeologist. He studied Architecture and Egyptology, focussed on Ancient Egyptian architecture. His admiration and curiosity for Egypt led him to the excavations of the bust of Nefertiti.</p>

    <p STYLE="text-indent: 10%;">Borchardt’s team had an agreement to split the artifacts they found with the Egyptian government. </p> According to the Antiquities Law that came into existence in 1912 in Egypt,  the findings of the excavation had to be split in half, giving the first choice to the Antiquities Service5. The French managed the Egyptian Antiquities Department, this indicates that there was already a preexisting Western bias in place (Van de Beek, 2019). The bust of Nefertiti was part of the German portion and was consigned from the land she once ruled to a place she never knew existed. Her new home for the next 11 years was in the private residence of Jacques Simon, who funded the expedition (History.com Editors, 2019). In 1924, the bust of Nefertiti made her first real life public appearance in the Neues Museum in Berlin. This museum was established in 1855 and houses two galleries, one of these galleries is the Ägyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung, which presents the art of Antique Egypte (Bianchini, 2019).
    During World War II the bust of Nefertiti was hidden by the nazi’s in a salt mine. American troops found it after Hitlers death and placed it in a museum in West Berlin. The Neues Museum was rebuilt after it was bombed in the war, so in 2009 the bust returned to the museum (Weird History, 2020).

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">Looking back on the journey that the bust of Nefertiti made; from the workshop of Thutmose to the Neues Museum in Berlin, one thing is clear: her story develops from a Western point of view. Nowhere in the story of the finding of the bust, the Egptian side is depicted. Edward Said explained in his book Orientalism, why this occurs. What happens when the western point of view takes over and values their own interpretation the most. Said demonstrate this through the example of how the french writer Gustave Flaubert depicts Kuchuk Hanem, a Ghawazee6 dancer of Esna7 (“Kuchuk Hanem”, 2020):</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
      <div>“There is very little consent to be found, for example, in the fact that Flaubert’s encounter with an Egyptian courtesan produced a widely influential model of the Oriental woman; she never spoke for herself, she never represented her emotions, presence, or history. He spoke for and represented her. He was foreign, comparatively wealthy, male, and these were historical facts of domination that allowed him not only to possess Kuchuk Hamen physically but to speak for her and tell his readers in what way she was “typically Oriental.” My argument is that Flaubert’s situation of strength in relation to Kuchuk Hamen was not an isolated instance. It fairly stands for the pattern of relative strength between the East and West, and the discourse about the Orient that it enabled.”
      (Said, 1978, p. 6) </div>
    </div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">From the moment that Ludwig Bogardt finds the bust and together with the Antiquities Service decides where the bust will be located, the narrative of the bust becomes an example of colonialism. Colonialism is defined as when the control or governing of a nation determines over a dependent country or communities. (“Colonialism”, n.d.). This explains why there are so many different interpretations of the story of Nefertiti. Through the years various parties had the authority over her and her narrative. Still, the bust of Nefertiti origin starts in Egypte, she is a symbol of their culture and history. By distorting the bust’s origin and what it represents, the connection between her and her identity got lost. The bust of Nefertiti got out of context the moment she was put on display in the museum. With her placement in the Neues Museum, the curators of this museum decide how the narrative of the bust cultivates.
    They determine what side of the story they highlight, in what kind of direction they want to lead the spectator. It is their interpretation. The following text is the description of the bust on the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin8 website. This shows how the Neues Museum is composing the viewer to look at the bust of Nefertiti from a Western point of view:</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
      “The colorfully painted bust of Nefertiti has already been described in so many catalog articles, art-historical treatises and specialist articles by well-known Egyptologists that one could leave it at this point with the famous words of Borchardt and only try to quote “describe is no use, look”. For this reason - as with the bust of the Pharaoh - only Borchardt’s own descriptions are to be cited, the conclusions of which are certainly worth discussing, but give an authentic picture of his precise powers of observation and should speak for themselves.”
      (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, n.d.)
    </div>
    </div>
      <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">The attitude of the Western countries towards the originating countries of the stolen object ensures that the story of the object will be represented in a western point of view. Said wrote about this in his book Orientalism:</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
      “The exteriority of the representation is always governed by some version of the truism that if the Orient could represent itself, it would; since it cannot, the representation does the job, for the West9, and faute de mieux10 for the poor Orient. “Sie können sich nicht vertreten, sie müssen vertreten werden.”11 as Marx12 wrote in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.”  (Said, 1978, p. 21)

    <div class="bodytext">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">Museums have an important role in telling the story of a looted cultural heritage object. What museums tend to do is that they present their collections as being from dead civilizations, partly because the objects depict ancient times. The objects are decontextualized and because of this, they might become dead objects as well. That is why it is important that the missions of the museums is to make this knowledge and artifacts as accessible as possible. The question is to what extent do the museums try to reach these missions? The bust of Nefertiti is one of the highlights in the collection of the Neues Museum. This museum is open to the public, but this public is limited. Not everybody can come to Berlin, not everybody can pay the 12 euros entrance fee (Aksioma, 2019). This means that the people of the culture where the object is originally from need to pay a fee to have access to their own culture. In colonial times these people were treated horribly and were forced to distance themselves from their beliefs. Portraying the visualizations of these beliefs in museums in Western society is a fictional reality of what happened in the past. Making the collection approachable online, is a good way to include the public. The public that has no ability to travel or has no money to spare can thereby get involved. Sadly, when you enter the online collections database of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin the information is in German, even when you click on the EN icon, to get englisch access to the information, it does not change (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, n.d.). Without the possibility to access the information in English the group that gets an exclusive inside of the bust gets therefore smaller and smaller.
    In conclusion, the bust of Nefertiti made a long journey from where she was found to where she is located now. The journey is created from a Western point of view. The meaning of the bust  got lost the moment she was put on display in the museum. By granting limited access to the bust of Nefertiti, Germany will have the power over the narrative of the bust. By giving this power to one party the truth and history gets destroyed.</p>

    Outdated theories
  </div>

  <div class="bodytext_groot">
      For many years now Egypte has wanted to have the bust of Nefertiti back. In 1930, Egypte made their first attempt by requesting the return of the bust, but the German government declined. In 2009, the collectoin’s director of the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection of the Neues Museum, Frederike Syfried claims that:
      <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
      <div>
      “The position of the German side is clear and unambiguous - the acquisition of the bust by the Prussian state was legal.” (BBC, 2009)</div></div>

      <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">So because of this the Neues Museum is still refusing to give the bust back. The ignorant attitude of Berlin towards Egypte is a common demeanor in the discussion of looted cultural heritage objects and the question who the rightful owner is. Other European countries share this approach towards the claims countries make on their collections. England for example possesses the Parthenon Marbles13. These marbles are originally from Greece. Greece made countless attempts to get the Parthenon Marbles back, in vain England refused to renounce the statues. Their counter reactions were that London was the most suitable place to store them, that the air pollution in Athene would damage the Parthenon Marbles and that the statues will be placed in a museum that is not suitable for conservering the statues. These arguments are obsolete, because Engeland did not take good care of the Parthenon Marbles itself.
      The statues were irreplaceably damaged in their stay in the British Museum.</p>

      In 1936, Lord Duveen of Millbank, who was an influential British art dealer, recommended that the statues should be thoroughly cleaned. He believed that the statues should be white. Incompetent cleaners were using chisels, caustic chemicals and steel wool. This resulted in the damage of 80 percent of the surface of the Parthenon Marbles and the loss of a lot of details on the marbles(Visser, 2017).

      <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">This attitude shows that there is still inequality in how Western societies behaves towards the countries that were their former colonies. With declining requests about the return of the art objects and with the arguments they use, European museums are degrading the countries exactly in the way they did during the colonization.</p>

      Changing of attitude
    </div>

  <div class="bodytext">
    The discussion about how the Western societies are managing the looted cultural heritage objects and how their attitude is towards the countries that originally owned them, caused a lot of commotion. People criticize the museum and government14 in how they deal with the looted cultural heritage objects. Every country has another history and through the course of their past reacts differently on this issue. When we look at Germany their response was completely different than the Netherlands or France. This is because the colonies that German15 acquired were taken away from them in the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. When the other European countries were occupied with their colonies after World War II, Germany was handling something completely different, the aftermath of this war. Nicholas Thomas, director of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge, said about this:

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “The public historical debate in Germany was completely absorbed by consideration of the Nazi past and of the ramifications of division. There has been much more discussion of empires in Britain, France and the Netherlands, where people in museums have thought much more about where collections have come from, and there is a deeper awareness of the sheer historical complexity.” (Bowley, 2018)
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">The conversation about the looted cultural heritage object started in Germany with the opening of Humboldt Forum in 2018 in Berlin. The museum collection consists of many ethnological objects that were accumulated during the colonial era. The discussion of bringing back stolen artifacts has been going on for a very long time, so why would Germany think that it would be a good idea to create a new museum that represents looted cultural heritage objects? With showing a Buddist temple and boats from the South Pacific, the Humboldt Forum will give an example of how open Germany is to the world. It would also give Germany another world-class institution, tantamount to the British Museum or the Louvre (Bowley, 2018). Edward Said explains in his book Orientalism that when Western countries consistently represent looted cultural heritage objects that are not connected to the Western culture, they retain the Western view of the Orient:</p>
    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “That Orientalism16 makes sense at all depends more on the West than on the Orient, and this sense is directly indebted to various Western techniques of representation that make the Orient visible, clear, “there” in discourse about it. And these representations rely upon institutions, traditions, conversations, agree-upon codes of understanding for their effects, not upon a distant and amorphous Orient.” (Said, 1978, p. 22)
    </div></div>

  </div>

  <div class="bodytext_groot">
    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">So the reason why they wanted to develop this museum is in conflict with what they represent and how they displayed it. A museum that exhibits looted cultural heritage objects is not showing how open they are for other cultures, but how closed they are by not giving the cultures who are the original owners of the objects an opportunity to get access to that object. People were not amused by the building of the Humboldt Forum. In February 2018, hundred protesters marched through Berlin’s streets to the Humboldt Forum. The protesters gave speeches and held signs that said:</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “Tell the Truth About Germany’s Colonial History,”
    “Clear Out the Colonial Treasury” and “It’s Your Duty to Remember.”
      </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">One protester, Christian Kopp, addressed that no matter what the founders had intended, the museum would forever be associated with the blood of the empire.</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “This,”
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">  he said, pointing to the grand stone facade of the Humboldt Forum,</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “will be a memorial to the colonial era!”
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">(Bowley, 2018).
    One of the Forum’s three founding directors, Horst Bredekamp, who is an art historian, defines this protest as a</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “psychogram of Germany’’
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">  and said that the critical pushback is hijacking the original purpose of focusing on German scientific enlightenment and exploration (Bowley, 2018). Not everybody that works for the Neues Museum was agreeing with the museum’s representation.
    The discussion around the construction of the Humbort Forum led for example to the resignation of Bénédicte Savoy, an advisory board member of the museum.</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    He states that the museum does not reflect modern Germany that is changed by immigration (Bowley, 2018).
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;">People see the Humboldt Form as something positive or negative. With the building of The Forum the starting point of this debate between the two sides surrounding stolen cultural heritage objects in Germany began.
    The professor of the University of Hamburg and expert on African history and colonialism, Jürgen Zimmerer, said</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “There is a lot more at stake than just the museum. The political colonial debate has become the defining debate in Germany and the Humboldt Forum is at the center of it” (Bowley, 2018).
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;"> One of the Forum’s three founding directors Neil MacGregor said:</p>

    <div class="toptexts2" id="toptexts2">
    <div>
    “It is called a “forum” because its organizers want it to be more than a museum — a place for meeting, discussing and investigation of big global issues like immigration” (Bowley, 2018).
    </div></div>

    <p STYLE="margin-left: 30%;"> The Humboldt Forum would be a wonderful place to start the conversation between the museum and the protesters. Like MacGregor said it is a place for discussing big global issues. What better way to talk about the colonial debate in a controversial building that provoked the discussion. One of the solutions for opening up the conversation with museums is talking to them and educating them. The Humboldt Forum came in action after the debate around the looted cultural heritage objects. They want to get rid of the assumptions that the Forum demonstrates only the German take on the world.
    So they made a proposal to introduce people that represent the countries where the objects originated from. Another result that resoluted out of the debate is that the German Lost Art Foundation, that focusses on the investigation of Nazi-looted art, is giving the museum a change to get a grant for the research of the colonial origin (Bowley, 2018).
    With these actions the museum and Germany shows that they are open for change.</p>
